# parse_regex

Project to house a tool to translate regular expressions into English and vice versa

The goal of this project is to be able to provide self-documentation of regular expressions.

Still to do:

- Include logic for '.' when unescaped
- Include logic for dealing with flags
- Turn this into a program that can take command line arguments.  *facepalm*
